## Background

If you frequently find yourself being added to repositories as a collaborator, you know how tedious finding and accepting the GitHub invite can be. We felt that too, especially as team leaders at @LambdaSchool.

To deal with this pain, we built [Doorman](https://doorman.notwrong.dev), a bouncer for your GitHub invites. After you authorize Doorman to access your GitHub account (don't worry, we only use the `repo:invite` scope), you'll be able to add GitHub users to your Allow or Block lists. Once you've done that, you're done! Doorman will check every 30minutes for any collaboration invitations you've recieved and will automatically accept or decline invites based on the users in your Allow and Block list. 

Get an invite from a user not in either list? That's fine! We'll leave it alone and you can handle it normally.
